#summary Setting up Subversion

= Introduction =

We'll use Subversion for the project so that we can all work off of the same copy of the code. It will allow us to do the project without having to meet up somewhere.

If you've never used Subversion before, you should read the first paragraph on its Wikipedia page ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_%28software%29 Subversion]) to see what it is and why it's used.


= Setup =
  # To use Subversion through Visual Studio 2008, you have to install a plugin. Download it  here and install it. http://ankhsvn.net/downloads/2.1/
